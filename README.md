evestment.searchRenderer
========================

The haackathon experimental rendering library.

The source folder contains an .Sln file and to folder you will need to run the example project. To just use the renderer 
all you need is the SearchRenderer.js file. 

To use this library simply reference it and then call the initalize method located in the evestment.searchRenderer namespace :

      <script src="../Scripts/SearchRenderer.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      
      <script type="text/javascript">
      
        //initialize takes the name of the canvas element you wish to render on
        evestment.searchRenderer.initialize('#cv');
      
      </script>
